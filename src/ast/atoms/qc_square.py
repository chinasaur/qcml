""" This is the square atom.

        square(x) = square_over_lin(x,1)

    If y is a vector, it computes the division elementwise.

    It is a CONVEX atom. It is NONMONOTONE in the first argument.

    If the first argument is POSITIVE, it is INCREASING in the first argument.
    If the first argument is NEGATIVE, it is DECRASING in the first argument.

    It returns a VECTOR expressions.

    In every module, you must have defined two functions:
        attributes :: [arg] -> (sign, vexity, shape)
        rewrite :: [arg] -> Program
