""" This is the sqrt atom.

        sqrt(x) = geo_mean(x,1)

    It is a CONCAVE atom. It is INCREASING in the first argument.

    It returns a VECTOR expressions.

    In every module, you must have defined two functions:
        attributes :: [arg] -> (sign, vexity, shape)
        rewrite :: [arg] -> Program
